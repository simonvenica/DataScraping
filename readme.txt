Project: CoinMarketCap Data Scraping

Description:
Over the last two days, I worked on a small project to showcase my knowledge of data scraping, JavaScript programming, MySQL, and algorithm development. The primary goal of this project was to demonstrate my ability to collect and process data from CoinMarketCap, a popular cryptocurrency data platform.

Project Details:
- Data Collection: I developed a web scraping script using JavaScript to extract information about the top 100 cryptocurrencies with the highest market capitalization from CoinMarketCap. This involved navigating a dynamic web page and retrieving data such as cryptocurrency names, prices, and market capitalizations.

- Data Storage: The scraped data was stored in a MySQL database for future analysis. MySQL was chosen as the database management system due to its reliability and efficiency.

- Algorithm Development: JavaScript algorithms were used to clean, transform, and analyze the collected data. These algorithms were essential for extracting meaningful insights from the raw data.

- Future Analysis: The project sets the stage for future analysis, which may involve using the collected data to make predictions about potential future price behaviors of cryptocurrencies. This could include applying various data analysis techniques and machine learning algorithms.

How to Use:
- To run the web scraping script, simply execute the JavaScript file. Make sure to configure the MySQL database connection before running the script.

- Use JavaScript scripts for data analysis and processing as needed for your future analysis and predictions.
